        <p>As winter approaches, we’ll be spending more time indoors. This will increase the risk of coronavirus spreading.</p>
        <p>The following reconstructions of everyday environments show why washing hands regularly, wearing a face covering and keeping at least 2m apart is vital in controlling the spread.</p>
        <p>Coronavirus can live for more than 24 hours indoors.</p>
        <p>You could pick up or pass on the virus by touching a contaminated surface.</p>
        <p>Washing your hands with soap and water, or using hand sanitiser, regularly throughout the day will reduce the risk of catching or passing it on.</p>
        <p>Coronavirus can be found in tiny droplets coming out of your nose and mouth.</p>
        <p>Wearing a face covering over your nose and mouth reduces the spread of droplets carrying the virus. This means if you have it, you’re less likely to pass it on to others.</p>
        <p>Larger droplets can land on other people or on surfaces they touch. Spreading the virus through droplets is most likely to happen when you are less than 2m apart.</p>
        <p>Smaller droplets called aerosols can stay in the air for some time, especially if there is no ventilation.</p>
        <p>So when you are with people not from your household, you must keep at least 2m apart.</p>
        <p>The risk of spreading the virus through smaller droplets is much less outdoors, where there is more ventilation.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands, cover your face, make space. These are the three most effective ways we can all control the spread of the virus.</p>
        <p>Remember if you have any coronavirus symptoms; high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change in your sense of taste or smell, get a free test by calling 119 or visiting NHS.uk.</p>
        <p>Together, we will control the virus and stop the spread.</p>
        <p>Don’t forget, Hands, Face, Space.</p>
